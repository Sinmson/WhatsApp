This project is a (frontend) replica of [WhatsApp (Web)](https://web.whatsapp.com)
The chat functionality will be implemented with Firebase and does not work with WhatsApp.

## Quick Start

### Requirements
If you want to run it in a DevContainer:
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [DevContains for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) (and its OS requiremnts)

For Windows:
I **suggest** to clone the repo in your WSL (Linux) environment and **not** on your windows file system. Else the hot-reload will not work well (you will have to enable --poll) and it is pretty slow.

### Installation
1. Clone Repo
2. Open VS Code
3. Open workspace/folder in (Dev) Container (first startup needs some time)


### Development server

Run `npm run frontend` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `npm run ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## TODOs

- [ ] Create Docker container with nginx server
- [ ] Build backend with firebase
- [ ] Connect to backend
- [ ] Move Code into components
- [ ] Oath Login for Github/Google/Etc.
